# marcinlib
Rcpp package for various functions related to scRNA-Seq

Writing a [Rcpp package](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-package.pdf) and Hadley's [guide for writing R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) are useful resources for package development. Specially, taking a look at the [Rcpp](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html) chapter of the book is nice.
